    question: "Do I need to create an account or register?",
    answer: "No, you don't need to create an account or register. Simply reach out to us via SMS or email, and we'll guide you through the process without requiring any personal information."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I pay for the session?",
    answer: "We charge a flat fee of â‚¹1000 per session. After scheduling, we'll send you payment instructions through your preferred anonymous communication channel. We accept various payment methods that maintain your privacy."
  },
  {
    question: "How is my privacy protected?",

    question: "Who are the counselors?",
    answer: "All our counselors are licensed professionals with advanced degrees in psychology, counseling, or related fields. They have extensive experience and specialized training in various areas of mental health. We match you with the most appropriate counselor based on your needs."

    answer: "We stand by our service quality. If you're not satisfied with your session, please let us know, and we'll either arrange a session with a different counselor or offer a refund. Your satisfaction and mental wellbeing are our priorities."
